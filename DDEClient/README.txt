DDEML Example Application.

This application is a demonstration of how to use the DDE Management Library (DDEML) through Visual Basic. The DDEML is a Win API programmtic alternative to the standard form based DDE mechanisms provided by Visual Basic. The demonstration is written for synchronous communication however it can easily be changed for async. Check the Microsoft Platform SDK documentation for more information concerning DDEML programming. Unfortuneately the MSDN documentation is focused on C++. There is vitually no documentation anywhere that deals with DDEML's use in VB so this example came about after considerable trial-and-error. Hopefully the included examples will make life much easier for others who may interested in using DDEML. The zip file contains an example server and an example client. The client includes capabilities for DDE Request, Execute, and Poke. It also includes the ability to setup an advise loop with the server (this is equivilent to a warm/hot link in form based VB). Enjoy!
